    <p class="text-example">A balanced diet is essential for maintaining good health because it provides the body with the
      diverse range of nutrients it needs to function optimally. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins supply energy and support bodily
      processes, while vitamins and minerals bolster immunity, strengthen bones, and aid in cell repair. By eating a variety of
      nutrient-dense foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins, and healthy fats, we ensure that our
      bodies receive the necessary components to prevent nutrient deficiencies, reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart
      disease and diabetes, and support mental well-being. Additionally, a balanced diet helps maintain a healthy weight and
      energy levels, which are crucial for overall physical and mental vitality.

    <div class="div-example"> Closing Statement
      <p>A variety of nutrient-rich foods in your diet supports long-term health, providing essential energy and reducing disease
        risks. Choosing grains, vegetables, meats, dairy, and fruits thoughtfully builds a foundation for well-being.<br><br>
        And remember—a balanced diet means a cookie in each hand!
