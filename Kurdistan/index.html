            <h2 id="General-information">About Kurdistan</h2>
            
                <p> Kurdistan means "Land of the Kurds." In Iraq’s laws, it’s called the Kurdistan Region, and the government there is
                    called the <br> Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). The KRG is sometimes called "Kurdistana Bashur" or "Southern Kurdistan"
                    because<br> it’s located in the southern part of the broader Kurdistan area. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Iraqi Kurdistan is an autonomous region within Iraq. It is surrounded by four countries: Iran to the east, Turkey to the
                    north, <br>Syria to the west, and the rest of Iraq to the south. The capital city of the region is Erbil, also known as Hawler. 
                    The Kurdistan<br> Regional Government helps take care of the region and its
                    people.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    According to the Fondation-Institut Kurde de Paris (2017), the Kurdish population is estimated to be between 36 and 46
                    million<br>people. It is the largest ethnic minority in the world without its own state (CNN 2024).

                <p> When you visit Kurdistan for the first time, you’ll see that the most noticeable feature is the mountains. There’s a
                    saying among Kurds:<br> "No friends but the mountains." This means that, for many years, the mountains have been the only
                    safe place for Kurds, away from<br> rulers or countries that try to control them. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The mountains are very important to the Kurdish people. They have helped shape the history, traditions, and culture of
                    the Kurds. <br>The mountains have also been used by Kurdish fighters, called Peshmerga, to hide and protect themselves while
                    fighting against<br> unfair rulers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Kurdistan is made up of many different mountain ranges, like the Zagros Mountains in the center and north, the Taurus
                    and Pontus <br>mountains in the east, and the Amanus mountains in the north. There are also Kurdish areas in the Alburz
                    Mountains in Iran and the<br> Pontian mountains in Turkey.
                </p>

                <h2 id="Kurdish-language">Kurdish Language</h2>
            
                <p> The official languages of the Kurdistan Region for government use are Kurdish and Arabic. Kurdish belongs to the
                    Indo-European<br> language family. The different dialects of Kurdish language include the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sorani</li>
                        <li>Kurmanji</li>
                        <li>Hawrami or Gorani</li>
                        <li>Zaza</li>
                    </ol>
                
                    The two main dialects of Kurdish are Sorani and Kurmanji, which are spoken by the majority of people. Other less
                    commonly spoken<br> dialects include Hawrami (also called Gorani) and Zaza.
