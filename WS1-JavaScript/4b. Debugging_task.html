      let i = 5; // 1st fix: Semicolon missing. "let k = 25;" used for correct reference. Semicolons are used to end a statement in JavaScript.
      let j = 10; // 2nd fix: Semicolon missing again. Reasoning provided in 1st fix.
      let k = 25; // spotting this and questioning the semicolon helped with problem-solving of the previous statements.
      let l = "Joe"; //3rd fix: This is not a variable. It's a string. Strings require quotation marks. I looked W3Schools and JavaScript.com for examples and reference.
      const arr = [3, 5, 7];

      if (i < j) {
        console.log("i");
      } else if (j > k) {
        console.log("k");
      } else {
        console.log("j"); // 4th fix: Closing quote was missing.
      }

      for (let i = 0; i < 3; ++i) { // 5th fix: Changed <= 3 to < 3. See below comment for further explanation.
        console.log(arr[i]);
      }

      /* Fix 5 explanation:

        Fix: Changed <= 3 to < 3 because arrays with 3 elements are from 0, 1, 2 only. 
        
        The array [3, 5, 7] has length 3 so 0, 1, and 2 are enough. 
        I changed <= 3 to < 3 in the for loop because W3Schools shows that arrays start at index 0, so my 3-element array [3, 5, 7] 
        has valid numbers from 0, 1, and 2 only. Accessing index 3 would make it undefined.

        Source: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp

        Specific Info: W3Schools states "Array indexes start with 0".

        The following example in W3Schools was also helpful for spotting and understanding the difference between < and <=.
        
        Example: Looping Array Elements

        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        let fLen = fruits.length;

        let text = "<ul>";
        for (let i = 0; i < fLen; i++) {
        text += "<li>" + fruits[i] + "</li>";
        }
        text += "</ul>";

        This code shows that (let i = 0; i < fLen; i++) uses < fLen not <= fLen.
